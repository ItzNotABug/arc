A Firebase RemoteConfig like solution for `appwrite`!

The API is designed to be familiar to those who have used Firebase RemoteConfig.

## Getting Started ðŸ› 
1. **Database**: Create a Database, name it as you want & set an ID.
Recommended ID: `remote_config` (configurable in the api).

2. **Collection**: Create a Collection, name it as you want & set an ID.
Recommended ID: `release` (configurable in the api).

3. **Attributes**: Create 2 attributes as `key`, `value` pattern.
Recommended: `key: String` & `value: String` (configurable in the api).
Ensure the size of the value attribute is sufficient, especially if you plan to store URLs or other long strings. I'd advise using a size of 1024 as a precaution.
